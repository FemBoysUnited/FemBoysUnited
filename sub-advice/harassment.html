    <!-- Section 2: Understanding Negativity and Its Impact -->
    <section class="negativity-impact-section">
        <h2>Understanding Negativity and Its Impact</h2>
        <p>Negativity can come in many forms, from harsh comments on social media to negative self-talk or unsupportive environments. It’s important to recognize that while negativity is a part of life, it doesn't define you. Here’s how negativity can impact you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Doubt:</strong> Constant negative feedback can erode self-confidence and make you question your value.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Exhaustion:</strong> Prolonged exposure to negativity can lead to burnout and stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Negative environments or criticism can make you feel isolated or unsupported.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Strategies for Dealing with Negative Feedback -->
    <section class="dealing-with-feedback-section">
        <h2>Strategies for Dealing with Negative Feedback</h2>
        <p>Whether it's online comments or negative reactions from others, here are some strategies for dealing with criticism effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don’t Take It Personally:</strong> Criticism is often more about the person giving it than about you. Separate yourself from the comment and try to view it objectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong> Remind yourself that you are worthy, capable, and deserving of kindness. Negative feedback doesn’t define your worth.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for Constructive Elements:</strong> Not all criticism is harmful. If there’s constructive feedback mixed in, use it to grow and improve.</li>
            <li><strong>Respond Calmly or Not at All:</strong> Avoid responding in anger. If you do decide to reply, keep it respectful. Alternatively, sometimes ignoring negativity is the best response.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 4: Handling Toxic Environments -->
    <section class="toxic-environments-section">
        <h2>Handling Toxic Environments</h2>
        <p>Whether it’s a negative workplace, social group, or online platform, toxic environments can be draining. Here’s how to cope with them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Don’t be afraid to set clear boundaries with toxic people. This may mean limiting your interactions or removing yourself from negative situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Find Positive Spaces:</strong> Seek out environments that foster positivity, support, and growth. Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals can help counterbalance the negativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a step back from negative environments, whether it’s social media, toxic groups, or stressful situations.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 5: Addressing Internal Negativity & Self-Doubt -->
    <section class="internal-negativity-section">
        <h2>Addressing Internal Negativity & Self-Doubt</h2>
        <p>Often, the most damaging negativity comes from within. Self-doubt and negative self-talk can hold you back. Here's how to tackle internal negativity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Challenge Negative Thoughts:</strong> When you notice negative thoughts creeping in, question their validity. Are they based on facts, or are they simply fears or insecurities?</li>
            <li><strong>Affirm Your Strengths:</strong> Regularly remind yourself of your strengths, accomplishments, and unique qualities. Practice self-affirmations to build confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Talk to friends, mentors, or a therapist who can provide encouragement and a fresh perspective when you're feeling low.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limit Exposure:</strong> You have the power to unfollow or mute accounts that consistently post negative content. Curate your social media feed to promote positivity and self-affirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t Engage with Trolls:</strong> Engaging with online trolls rarely leads to productive conversations. Often, it only fuels their negativity. It’s better to ignore and block.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Block and Report Features:</strong> If you encounter hate speech or bullying, make use of blocking or reporting features available on most platforms.</li>
        </ul>
