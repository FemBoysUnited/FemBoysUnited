    <!-- Section 2: General Skin Care Tips for the Whole Body -->
    <section class="general-skin-care-section">
        <h2>General Skin Care for Your Whole Body</h2>
        <p>Maintaining healthy skin starts with daily habits. Here are some tips to help you care for your skin:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drinking water is crucial for keeping your skin hydrated from the inside out.</li>
            <li><strong>Moisturize Daily:</strong> Use a good body moisturizer after showering to keep your skin soft and supple. Choose a product that suits your skin type—lighter lotions for oily skin and thicker creams for dry skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Exfoliate Weekly:</strong> Exfoliating removes dead skin cells, making your skin look smoother and feel softer. Be gentle, though, and avoid over-exfoliating, as it can irritate your skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect from the Sun:</strong> Always use sunscreen with a broad-spectrum SPF of at least 30. UV rays can cause premature aging and increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
            <li><strong>Shower with Lukewarm Water:</strong> Hot water can strip your skin of its natural oils, leaving it dry and irritated. Opt for lukewarm water instead.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Face Skin Care Routines for Different Skin Types -->
    <section class="face-skin-care-section">
        <h2>Face Skin Care Routine for Different Skin Types</h2>
        <p>Every skin type is different, and your face care routine should be tailored to meet your unique needs. Below are routines for common skin types:</p>

        <!-- Oily Skin -->
        <div class="skin-type-routine">
            <h3>Oily Skin Care Routine</h3>
            <p>Oily skin produces excess sebum, which can lead to clogged pores and acne. Follow these steps for a balanced routine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a gentle foaming or gel cleanser to remove excess oil. Avoid harsh cleansers that strip the skin of moisture, as this can lead to more oil production.</li>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Use a toner with ingredients like salicylic acid or witch hazel to control oil and prevent breakouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Even oily skin needs moisture. Choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to hydrate without clogging pores.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate (2-3 times a week):</strong> Physically Exfoliate or use a chemical exfoliant like BHA (salicylic acid) to help clear pores and reduce oil buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Opt for a non-comedogenic sunscreen that won’t clog pores, preferably gel-based or oil-free.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Dry Skin -->
        <div class="skin-type-routine">
            <h3>Dry Skin Care Routine</h3>
            <p>Dry skin lacks moisture and can feel tight and flaky. Here’s how to nourish and hydrate your skin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a creamy, hydrating cleanser that doesn’t strip natural oils. Avoid cleansers with alcohol or fragrances.</li>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Opt for a hydrating toner with ingredients like glycerin or hyaluronic acid to replenish moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Choose a rich, thick moisturizer that seals in hydration. Look for products with ceramides, shea butter, or oils like argan or jojoba.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate (once a week):</strong> Use a gentle exfoliant to slough off dead skin cells. Consider using a hydrating mask to lock in moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Always wear a hydrating sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to protect your skin from sun damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Combination Skin -->
        <div class="skin-type-routine">
            <h3>Combination Skin Care Routine</h3>
            <p>Combination skin can be oily in some areas (like the T-zone) and dry in others (like the cheeks). Here's how to balance both:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a gentle, balanced cleanser that won't strip your skin’s natural moisture. Consider a hydrating cleanser for dry areas and a more cleansing formula for oilier areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Use a gentle toner to remove excess oil in the T-zone and hydrate the drier parts of your face.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that hydrates without making your T-zone greasy.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate (1-2 times a week):</strong> Use a gentle exfoliant that won’t irritate dry patches but will remove excess oil in the T-zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Select a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a matte finish to control shine while protecting your skin.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Sensitive Skin -->
        <div class="skin-type-routine">
            <h3>Sensitive Skin Care Routine</h3>
            <p>Sensitive skin can react to various products, so the key is gentle care. Follow these tips to keep your skin calm and irritation-free:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use a fragrance-free, gentle cleanser that won't strip the skin of its natural oils. Look for products labeled “hypoallergenic” and “non-comedogenic.”</li>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Skip harsh toners with alcohol. Choose soothing toners with ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use a fragrance-free, hydrating moisturizer to prevent dryness and irritation.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate (1-2 times a week):</strong> If you need exfoliation, use a very mild scrub or a gentle enzyme exfoliant to avoid irritation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Choose a physical (mineral) sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are less likely to irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            </ul>
