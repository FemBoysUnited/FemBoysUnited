        <h1>💇 Hair Styling & Maintenance 💇</h1>
        <p>Maintaining healthy and styled hair is a journey that requires dedication to finding the right products, techniques, and routine. Whether you have straight, curly, or textured hair, there’s a personalized hair care regimen that will keep your locks looking fabulous!</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Section 2: Understanding Hair Types -->
    <section class="hair-types-section">
        <h2>Understanding Hair Types</h2>
        <p>Before choosing products and routines, it's important to understand your hair type and texture. Your hair type impacts what products and techniques will work best for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Straight Hair:</strong> Generally sleek and smooth, straight hair tends to lie flat against the scalp. It can get oily more quickly but is typically less prone to frizz.</li>
            <li><strong>Curly Hair:</strong> Curls can range from loose waves to tight ringlets. This hair type tends to be dry and can get frizzy, so it requires extra moisture and care to maintain its shape and health.</li>
            <li><strong>Coily Hair:</strong> Coily hair has tight, corkscrew-like curls and can be quite fragile. It needs regular moisturizing and is more prone to breakage if not cared for properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Textured Hair:</strong> This includes hair that has both wave and curl, with some areas being straight and others curly or wavy. It requires a balance of moisture and structure.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Shampoos & Conditioners for Different Hair Types -->
    <section class="shampoos-conditioners-section">
        <h2>Choosing the Right Shampoo & Conditioner</h2>
        <p>Different hair types and textures require specific shampoos and conditioners for optimal results. Here's a breakdown:</p>
        <div class="hair-type-products">
            <div class="product-box">
                <h3>Shampoos for Curly or Coily Hair</h3>
                <p>Shampoos for curly or coily hair should be sulfate-free to prevent dryness and frizz. Look for moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, or argan oil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-box">
                <h3>Shampoos for Straight Hair</h3>
                <p>Straight hair tends to get oily quickly, so shampoos that help remove excess oil without over-stripping are ideal. Lightweight formulas with a focus on volume and shine work best.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-box">
                <h3>Conditioners for Fine or Thin Hair</h3>
                <p>For fine hair, use lightweight conditioners that won’t weigh down your strands. Look for formulas that add volume and hydration without making hair limp.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-box">
                <h3>Conditioners for Thick or Dry Hair</h3>
                <p>Thick or dry hair benefits from rich, hydrating conditioners with oils and proteins that lock in moisture and protect against frizz and damage.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Hair Care Techniques & Maintenance -->
    <section class="hair-care-techniques-section">
        <h2>Hair Care Techniques & Daily Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Once you've chosen the right products, it's time to implement a daily and weekly maintenance routine. Here's how to keep your hair looking and feeling its best:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When to Wash:</strong> Washing your hair too frequently can strip it of its natural oils. For most hair types, washing 2-3 times a week is sufficient. Curly and coily hair may benefit from even less frequent washing.</li>
            <li><strong>How to Wash:</strong> When washing, focus on massaging the scalp to promote circulation, but avoid harsh scrubbing that could cause breakage. Use lukewarm water to cleanse and cold water to rinse to close the hair cuticles.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Conditioning:</strong> Once a week, treat your hair to a deep conditioning mask. This provides extra moisture and nourishment, especially for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li><strong>Protective Styles:</strong> To avoid breakage, incorporate protective styles like braids or twists that reduce the amount of heat and friction on your hair.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Protection:</strong> Always apply a heat protectant when using styling tools like flat irons or curling wands. This helps shield hair from damage caused by heat.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 5: Dealing with Common Hair Issues -->
    <section class="common-hair-issues-section">
        <h2>Dealing with Common Hair Issues</h2>
        <p>Everyone deals with a few hair challenges from time to time. Here's how to combat common hair issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frizz:</strong> To prevent frizz, ensure you’re using the right moisturizing products. Avoid brushing curly hair when dry; instead, detangle it while wet with a wide-tooth comb.</li>
            <li><strong>Breakage:</strong> Hair breakage is often caused by over-styling or heat damage. Consider using silk or satin pillowcases, avoiding tight hairstyles, and limiting the use of heat tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Split Ends:</strong> Regular trims are key to preventing and managing split ends. Aim for a trim every 6-8 weeks.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="hair-accessories-protection-section">
        <h2>Hair Accessories & Protection</h2>
        <p>Protecting your hair while you sleep or when out in the sun is essential for maintaining its health:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Silk/Satin Bonnets or Pillowcases:</strong> These materials reduce friction, prevent breakage, and minimize frizz, helping to keep your hair smooth overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Hair Ties:</strong> Avoid using rubber bands that can damage hair. Opt for fabric-covered or spiral hair ties that reduce tension and breakage.</li>
        </ul>

    <!--Section 7: Nutrition for Healthy Hair -->
<section class="nutrition-section">
<h2>Nutrition for Healthy Hair</h2>
<p>Your hair's health isn't just dependent on external products—what you eat matters too! Here are some nutrients that promote strong, healthy hair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biotin:</strong> Biotin supports hair growth and strength. Consider adding biotin-rich foods like eggs, nuts, and avocados to your diet.</li>
<li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids:</strong> Found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, omega-3s help nourish the hair follicles.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin E:</strong> Essential for scalp health, vitamin E helps improve circulation, which can support hair growth. Include spinach, almonds, and sunflower seeds in your diet.</li>
<li><strong>Zinc:</strong> Zinc promotes healthy hair and prevents hair loss. Foods rich in zinc include chickpeas, pumpkin seeds, and cashews.</li>
</ul>
