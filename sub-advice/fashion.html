    <!-- Section 2: Understanding Your Body Shape -->
    <section class="advice-details-section">
        <h2>Understanding Your Body Shape</h2>
        <p>Before you dive into styling yourself, it's important to understand your body shape. Knowing your measurements and body type will help you choose clothes that fit and flatter your form.</p>
        <p>There are several common body shapes, and dressing for each one can enhance your confidence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple Shape:</strong> Wider at the top, with a fuller bust and a smaller lower body. Choose clothes that balance your proportions, such as A-line skirts and dresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Pear Shape:</strong> Narrower shoulders and a fuller bottom half. Try clothes that accentuate your upper body, like off-the-shoulder tops or jackets that draw attention upwards.</li>
            <li><strong>Hourglass Shape:</strong> Balanced bust and hips with a smaller waist. Emphasize your curves with fitted clothing, such as tailored dresses and high-waisted pants.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectangle Shape:</strong> A straighter figure with little waist definition. Create the illusion of curves with belted dresses or tops that flare out at the waist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By understanding your body shape, you can find pieces that highlight your natural features and create a flattering silhouette.</p>
